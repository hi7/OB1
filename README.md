## One Button only Game console.

Creativity can thrive when constains are severe. 
So here is the challenge:

### "Write programms that can do something with only one button."

This project has started to explore exactly this.
I connected a [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) to a 
[Waveshare 2" LCD Module](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2inch_LCD_Module) 
with the [Arduino_GFX](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX) 
library to drive the ST7789. As Button I use a [Mini Pushbutton Switch](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/97).
